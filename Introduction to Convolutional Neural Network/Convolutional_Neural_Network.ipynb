    "This week we are going to learn about what Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are and why we use them to process image data rather than just plain neural networks and after that we will learn about recurrent Neural Networks to process time-series data such as speech recognition or named entity recognition, named entity recognition just means to identify which word is a name in a sentence. We will use tensorflow to implement both types of network and will learn about transfer learning in computer vision applications through CNNs.\n"
